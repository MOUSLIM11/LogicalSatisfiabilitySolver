# ESI-EX-INI Logic Formula Solver

A powerful tool for logical formula analysis and automated theorem proving using resolution.

## Features

- Create and save logical formulas in CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form)
- Test existing formulas for satisfiability
- View and manage your formula collection
- User-friendly graphical interface
- Real-time formula preview with proper logical notation

## Installation

1. Make sure you have the following files in your directory:
   - `gui_solver.exe` (the main application)
   - `logic_solver.exe` (the core solver engine)

2. No additional installation is required - the application is ready to use.

## How to Use

### Main Menu

The application starts with a main menu offering four options:

1. **Create New Formula**
   - Enter a name for your formula (without .cnf extension)
   - Specify the number of clauses
   - Add each clause one by one
   - Clauses are automatically saved in CNF format

2. **Test Existing Formula**
   - View a list of all available .cnf files
   - Select a formula to test
   - View the results in a popup window

3. **Show Available Formulas**
   - Browse all your saved formulas
   - Preview formula contents with proper logical notation
   - Test selected formulas directly

4. **Show Credits**
   - View information about the developers

### Creating a Formula

1. Click "Create New Formula"
2. Enter a name for your formula (letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens only)
3. Enter the number of clauses
4. For each clause:
   - Enter literals separated by spaces
   - Use ! for negation (e.g., !P for NOT P)
   - Example: `P !Q R` represents (P OR NOT Q OR R)
5. The formula will be saved automatically in CNF format

### Formula Syntax

- Use capital letters for variables (e.g., P, Q, R)
- Use ! for negation (e.g., !P for NOT P)
- Separate literals with spaces
- Each line represents a clause
- Clauses are automatically connected with AND (^)
- Literals within a clause are automatically connected with OR (V)

Example:
```
P !Q R
!P S
T !U
```
This represents: (P V !Q V R) ^ (!P V S) ^ (T V !U)

### Testing Formulas

1. Click "Test Existing Formula" or "Show Available Formulas"
2. Select a formula from the list
3. Click "Test Selected Formula"
4. View the results in the popup window

## Tips

- Use meaningful names for your formulas
- Keep formulas organized in a logical structure
- Use the preview feature to verify formula contents before testing
- The solver will automatically convert formulas to CNF format
